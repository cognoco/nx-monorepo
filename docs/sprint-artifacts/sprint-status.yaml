# ============================================
# PLANNING DASHBOARD - Review Before Each Sprint
# ============================================
# This section helps you quickly identify what needs your input vs. what can run autonomously.

planning_notes:
  # Stories that REQUIRE your input before starting
  # These cannot proceed without decisions from you
  requires_input:
    # 2-1 and 2-2 COMPLETED - Hybrid approach decided: Playwright for CI/committed tests, TestSprite for PRD validation

    - story: 3-1-set-up-sentry-project-and-configuration
      reason: "Need Sentry account access or decision on observability platform"
      decision_type: service-access

    - story: 4-2-configure-supabase-auth-project-settings
      reason: "Auth settings: email verification on/off, password requirements, OAuth providers?"
      decision_type: configuration-choice

    - story: 5-1-select-staging-platform
      reason: "Choose staging host: Vercel, Railway, Render, or Fly.io?"

    - story: 13-1-select-production-platforms
      reason: "Choose 2 production platforms to demonstrate portability"

  # Stories that CAN run autonomously with clear acceptance criteria
  # You can kick these off and review results later

# STATUS DEFINITIONS:
# ==================
# Epic Status:
#   - backlog: Epic exists in epic file but not contexted
#   - contexted: Epic tech context created (required before drafting stories)
#
# Story Status:
#   - backlog: Story only exists in epic file
#   - drafted: Story file created in stories folder
#   - ready-for-dev: Draft approved and story context created
#   - in-progress: Developer actively working on implementation
#   - review: Under SM review (via code-review workflow)
#   - done: Story completed
#
# Retrospective Status:
#   - optional: Can be completed but not required
#   - completed: Retrospective has been done
#
# WORKFLOW NOTES:
# ===============
# - Epics should be 'contexted' before stories can be 'drafted'
# - Stories can be worked in parallel if team capacity allows
# - SM typically drafts next story after previous one is 'done' to incorporate learnings
# - Dev moves story to 'review', SM reviews, then Dev moves to 'done'
