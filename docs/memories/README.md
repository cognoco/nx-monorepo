# Memory System Documentation

## Overview

This directory contains the monorepo's **institutional knowledge** - the patterns, decisions, and discoveries that define how this codebase works. It serves as long-term memory for AI agents and documentation for developers.

**Purpose**: Prevent pattern drift, avoid rework, and ensure consistency as the monorepo evolves.

---

## The Problem We're Solving

### Scenario: Pattern Drift

**Month 1**: Generate `apps/web` with Nx → adopt co-located tests in `src/`
**Month 6**: Generate `apps/mobile` with Nx → framework defaults to `__tests__/` directory
**Result**: Two different test patterns in the same monorepo ❌

### Scenario: Forgotten Constraints

**Month 1**: Discover Prisma packages need `--bundler=none`, document in tech log
**Month 6**: New developer generates database package with `--bundler=tsc`
**Result**: Hours wasted debugging broken imports ❌

### Scenario: Architectural Regression

**Month 1**: Decide on `moduleResolution: nodenext` for workspace compatibility
**Month 6**: Agent sees generated `node10`, thinks "this is the new standard"
**Result**: Workspace configuration breaks, tests fail ❌

### The Solution: Memory System

This directory captures **transferable knowledge** that applies across multiple components, ensuring consistency and preventing rework.

---

## Memory Files

### 1. `adopted-patterns.md`

**Purpose**: "This is how WE do it in THIS monorepo" - overrides framework defaults

**Content**:
- Test file locations (co-located in `src/`)
- TypeScript configuration standards (`moduleResolution: nodenext`)
- Jest configuration patterns (workspace preset inheritance)
- Code organization conventions
- Dependency version standards

**When to read**:
- Before generating new apps or packages
- Before changing build/test/TypeScript configurations
- Before making architectural suggestions
- When onboarding new team members

**When to update**:
- When establishing a new convention that applies across components
- When framework defaults conflict with our monorepo standards
- When solving a problem that will recur in similar components

**Example entry**:
```markdown
## Pattern: Test File Location

**Our Standard**: Co-located tests in `src/` directory

**When adding new apps**:
- ⚠️ Generators may create `__tests__/` directory
- ✅ Required action: Move tests to `src/` to match our standard
```

---

### 2. `post-generation-checklist.md`

**Purpose**: Mandatory steps after running Nx generators

**Content**:
- After `nx g @nx/jest:configuration`: Update TypeScript module resolution
- After `nx g @nx/js:lib`: Verify test location matches adopted pattern
- After `nx g @nx/node:app`: Check TypeScript version consistency
- After generating Prisma packages: Install dependencies, create directory structure

**When to read**:
- Immediately before running any `nx g` command (to prepare)
- Immediately after running any `nx g` command (to execute fixes)

**When to update**:
- When discovering a generator creates code that needs fixing
- When the fix is required for consistency with adopted patterns
- When the fix will apply to future uses of the same generator

**Example entry**:
```markdown
## After: `nx g @nx/jest:configuration`

### Required Actions

1. Update `tsconfig.spec.json`:
   - Change `"moduleResolution": "node10"` → `"nodenext"`

2. Validation:
   - Run `pnpm exec nx run <project>:test`
```

---

### 3. `tech-findings-log.md`

**Purpose**: Technical decisions, empirical findings, known constraints

**Content**:
- Why Prisma packages use `--bundler=none` (architectural constraint)
- Why we use `import type` for server router types (technical pattern)
- Jest hanging on Windows (empirical troubleshooting)
- Nx cache corruption patterns (operational findings)

**When to read**:
- Before suggesting architecture changes
- When troubleshooting build/test/runtime errors
- When making technology stack decisions
- When evaluating alternatives to current approaches

**When to update**:
- When making a technical decision with non-obvious rationale
- When discovering empirical findings from troubleshooting
- When identifying constraints or limitations of tools/frameworks
- When investigating alternatives and rejecting them for specific reasons

**Difference from adopted-patterns.md**:
- Tech findings = **why** (rationale, constraints)
- Adopted patterns = **what** (standards, conventions)

---

### 4. `known-issues.md` *(Future - Phase 2)*

**Purpose**: Active bugs, workarounds, temporary solutions

**Content**:
- Jest hanging on Windows (workaround: `NX_DAEMON=false`)
- Nx cache corruption (fix: `nx reset`)
- Temporary patches waiting for upstream fixes

**When to read**:
- When encountering errors that match symptom patterns
- Before suggesting "fixes" that might conflict with known workarounds

**When to update**:
- When discovering a temporary fix for a recurring issue
- When finding a workaround that helps troubleshooting

**When to remove**:
- When issues are permanently resolved upstream
- When workarounds are no longer needed

**Difference from tech-findings-log.md**:
- Known issues = temporary problems with workarounds
- Tech findings = permanent architectural decisions

---

### 5. `integration-recipes.md` *(Future - Phase 2)*

**Purpose**: How to connect component A to component B

**Content**:
- How web app calls REST API server (client initialization, error handling)
- How server connects to Prisma database (singleton pattern, pooling)
- How to use Supabase auth in Next.js (server vs client components)
- How to use Supabase auth in Expo (session persistence)
- How to share Zod schemas between server and client

**When to read**:
- When implementing features that cross architectural boundaries
- When adding new apps that need to integrate with existing services
- When refactoring integration code

**When to update**:
- When figuring out how to connect two layers for the first time
- When discovering better integration approaches
- When solving integration problems that will apply to other components

---

### 6. `architecture-decisions.md` *(Future - Phase 2)*

**Purpose**: High-level strategic choices with rationale

**Content**:
- Why oRPC instead of tRPC, REST, or gRPC
- Why Supabase + Prisma instead of alternatives
- Why monorepo instead of polyrepo
- Why pnpm instead of npm/yarn
- Why Nx instead of Turborepo

**When to read**:
- Before suggesting alternative architectures
- When explaining project decisions to stakeholders
- When evaluating technology migrations

**When to update**:
- When making major architectural decisions
- When choosing between competing technologies
- When rejecting alternatives for documented reasons

**Difference from tech-findings-log.md**:
- Architecture decisions = strategic "what" and "why" (business/tech trade-offs)
- Tech findings = tactical "how" (implementation details)

---

### 7. `current-task.md` *(Future - as needed)*

**Purpose**: Active work state for cross-session continuity

**Content**:
- What stage/substage is in progress
- What was just completed
- What's next
- Blockers or open questions
- Context for next agent session

**When to read**:
- At the start of every AI agent session
- When resuming work after interruption

**When to update**:
- Frequently during long tasks (every 30-60 minutes)
- Before reaching context limits
- When completing substages
- When encountering blockers

**When to clear**:
- When phase/stage is complete
- When starting entirely new work

---

## Agent Workflow Integration

### Session Start
```
1. Read current-task.md (if exists) - where did we leave off?
2. Read relevant sections of adopted-patterns.md - what are our standards?
```

### Before Generating Components
```
1. Read adopted-patterns.md - what patterns must I follow?
2. Read post-generation-checklist.md - what will I need to fix?
3. Run: nx g <command>
```

### After Generating Components
```
1. Execute post-generation-checklist.md - apply mandatory fixes
2. Validate against adopted-patterns.md - does it match our standards?
3. Test: build, lint, test targets work correctly
```

### When Implementing Features
```
1. Read integration-recipes.md - how do components connect?
2. Read tech-findings-log.md - any constraints I should know about?
3. Implement following established patterns
```

### When Troubleshooting
```
1. Read known-issues.md - is this a known problem with a workaround?
2. Read tech-findings-log.md - any empirical findings related to this?
3. Search for similar symptoms
```

### Before Suggesting Changes
```
1. Read architecture-decisions.md - why did we choose our current approach?
2. Read adopted-patterns.md - does this conflict with established patterns?
3. Read tech-findings-log.md - were alternatives already rejected?
```

### During Long Tasks
```
1. Update current-task.md - checkpoint progress every 30-60 minutes
2. Update adopted-patterns.md - if discovering new cross-component patterns
3. Update tech-findings-log.md - if discovering new constraints
```

## Memory System Principles

### 1. Cross-Component Knowledge

Memory captures **transferable patterns** that apply to **multiple similar contexts**.

✅ **DO capture**:
- "When you generate ANY package with Jest, update moduleResolution to nodenext"
- "How to integrate oRPC client in React-based apps (web, mobile)"
- "TypeScript configuration standards for ALL projects"

❌ **DON'T capture**:
- Single-use fixes ("Fixed bug in web/page.tsx line 42")
- Component-specific details ("Web app uses port 3000")
- Already well-documented patterns (standard Next.js routing)

### 2. Non-Obvious Knowledge

Memory captures what ISN'T obvious from official documentation.

✅ **DO capture**:
- Integration patterns combining multiple technologies
- Empirical findings from troubleshooting
- Monorepo-specific configuration requirements

❌ **DON'T capture**:
- Standard framework documentation (link to official docs instead)
- Self-explanatory code patterns
- Generic programming concepts

### 3. Recurring Patterns

Memory captures knowledge you'll need **again when adding similar components**.

✅ **DO capture**:
- Post-generation fixes that apply to every similar generator
- Integration patterns used by multiple apps
- Configuration patterns repeated across packages

❌ **DON'T capture**:
- One-time migrations or refactorings
- Historical context that won't affect future work
- Deprecated patterns no longer in use

### 4. Preventive Knowledge

Memory captures **solutions to prevent future problems**.

✅ **DO capture**:
- "Don't use --bundler=tsc for Prisma packages" (prevents broken imports)
- "Always check test location after generation" (prevents pattern drift)
- "Verify TypeScript version matches workspace" (prevents version conflicts)

❌ **DON'T capture**:
- Problems that only occurred once
- Issues resolved by updating dependencies
- Bugs fixed in code (not configuration/patterns)

## How to Maintain the Memory System

### Regular Maintenance

**Monthly review** (recommended):
1. Review `known-issues.md` - remove resolved issues
2. Review `current-task.md` - clear if stale
3. Review `adopted-patterns.md` - update "Last Validated" dates
4. Check for patterns that should be moved between files

**When updating frameworks**:
1. Test post-generation-checklist.md with new generator versions
2. Update "Last Validated" dates in adopted-patterns.md
3. Document any new generator issues discovered

**When adding new apps/packages**:
1. Follow existing patterns from memory files
2. Document any NEW patterns discovered
3. Update checklists if generators behave differently

### Quality Standards

**Good memory entry**:
- Clear, concise, actionable
- Includes rationale (why, not just what)
- Has validation steps
- Links to related docs
- Dated with "Last Validated"

**Bad memory entry**:
- Vague or ambiguous
- No explanation of why
- No way to verify if applied correctly
- Orphaned (no context for when to use it)

## FAQ

### Why not just use code comments?

Code comments explain **individual files**. Memory files explain **cross-component patterns** and **monorepo-wide decisions**.

### Why not use external documentation tools?

External tools require context switching. Memory files live in the repo, are version-controlled, and are immediately accessible to AI agents.

### How is this different from CLAUDE.md?

- `CLAUDE.md` = general agent behavior and project overview
- `docs/memories/` = specific patterns, decisions, and discoveries

### What if a pattern changes?

Update the relevant memory file, document the change, update "Last Validated" date, and notify the team. Memory evolves with the project.

### How do I know which file to update?

Use the decision tree:
- Monorepo-wide standard → `adopted-patterns.md`
- Post-generator fix → `post-generation-checklist.md`
- Technical constraint → `tech-findings-log.md`
- Temporary workaround → `known-issues.md`
- Integration pattern → `integration-recipes.md`
- Strategic decision → `architecture-decisions.md`
