# Phase 1: Walking Skeleton

## Introduction

### Purpose

This phase addresses a critical challenge in monorepo development: **how do you validate that all your infrastructure, tooling, and package versions are compatible before investing time in feature development?**

The answer is a **walking skeleton** - a minimal, end-to-end implementation that exercises the entire technical stack without implementing real features. Think of it as the monorepo equivalent of a "Hello World" that touches every layer of your architecture.

### The Problem We're Solving

It's easy to:
- ✅ Set up a Next.js app that works in isolation
- ✅ Configure Supabase and Prisma independently
- ✅ Create a Node.js server with perfect linting

But when you connect them together during actual feature development, you discover:
- ❌ Package version conflicts between web and server
- ❌ Prisma and Supabase have incompatible configurations
- ❌ Shared packages don't transpile correctly for different targets
- ❌ Build pipeline breaks when dependencies span multiple apps
- ❌ TypeScript paths don't resolve across workspace boundaries

**This phase front-loads those discoveries** so we fix infrastructure issues once, not repeatedly during POC development.

### The Walking Skeleton Approach

By the end of Phase 1, we will have:

1. **Two applications generated and validated**: Server (Express), Web (Next.js)
2. **All shared packages created**: database, schemas, api-client, supabase-client
3. **Minimal integration implemented**: One trivial feature (health check) that flows through every layer:
   - Web app → API client → Server → Database (via Prisma) → Supabase
4. **Complete QA infrastructure**: Husky, pre-commit hooks, comprehensive testing
5. **External services configured**: Sentry, NX Cloud, CodeRabbit, TestSprite (optional)

The "health check" feature is throwaway code - its only purpose is to prove the plumbing works. Once validated, we can confidently build the POC knowing the foundation is solid.

**Mobile app is deferred to Phase 2** - we validate web + server + database first, then add mobile complexity.

### Estimated Timeline

**Total: 7-11 hours** (1-1.5 days)

---

## Architecture Decisions

Before starting implementation, we need to understand the architectural relationships and make key technology choices.

### Prisma + Supabase Relationship

**Why both Prisma AND Supabase client?**

- **Prisma**: Server-side ORM for type-safe database access from Express API
  - Used exclusively in `apps/server` and `packages/database`
  - Provides schema management, migrations, and query builder
  - Connects to Supabase PostgreSQL database via connection string

- **Supabase Client**: Client-side SDK for authentication and realtime features
  - Used in `apps/web` and eventually `apps/mobile`
  - Provides authentication (login, signup, session management)
  - Provides realtime subscriptions (optional for POC)
  - **Does NOT handle CRUD operations** - those go through our API server

**Package responsibilities:**
- `packages/database`: Exports Prisma client singleton for server use
- `packages/supabase-client`: Exports auth client factory for web/mobile

### oRPC Type Flow

**How types flow from server to client:**

1. Server defines oRPC router with typed procedures in `apps/server/src/router.ts`
2. Server exports router type: `export type AppRouter = typeof router`
3. API client package imports the router type: `import type { AppRouter } from '@nx-monorepo/server/router'`
4. Client creates typed client: `createClient<AppRouter>(config)`
5. Web/mobile apps get full TypeScript autocomplete for all server endpoints

**Dependency flow:**
```
apps/web → packages/api-client → (type import only) apps/server
apps/server → packages/database → packages/schemas
packages/api-client → packages/schemas
```

**Note:** api-client depends on server for TYPE information only, not runtime code. This is safe.

### Architecture Decisions to Make

During Stage 4, we will explicitly decide:

- ☐ **API Architecture**: oRPC vs tRPC vs REST vs gRPC
- ☐ **Supabase Strategy**: Local CLI vs cloud project
- ☐ **Migration Strategy**: Prisma Migrate vs db push
- ☐ **Connection Strategy**: Service role vs anon key for Prisma
- ☐ **RLS Policy Approach**: How to handle Row Level Security

These decisions will be documented before proceeding with implementation.

## DECISION POINT: Mobile App Timing

At this point, the web walking skeleton is complete and validated. We have proven:
- ✅ Web app connects to server
- ✅ Server connects to database
- ✅ Type safety works across the stack
- ✅ All QA infrastructure works
- ✅ Package versions are compatible
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline passes

**Decision to make:** When do we add the mobile app?

### Option A: Add Mobile Now (Stage 8)
**Pros:**
- Complete full-stack validation before POC
- Mobile-specific issues discovered early
- Template is truly complete

**Cons:**
- Delays POC implementation
- Mobile adds significant complexity
- POC might not need mobile immediately

### Option B: Defer Mobile to Phase 2
**Pros:**
- Move faster to POC features
- Validate POC idea on web first
- Add mobile once POC is proven valuable

**Cons:**
- Mobile integration issues surface later
- Might need to refactor POC for mobile

**Recommendation:** Discuss this decision point before proceeding.

---

## Stage 8: Mobile App (Conditional - Likely Phase 2)

### Goal

Add mobile application to complete the full cross-platform walking skeleton. This stage is conditional based on the decision point above.

**Note:** This stage may become Phase 2 instead of Phase 1.

### Sub-stages

  - [ ] 8.1.3: **Immediate test**: Run `pnpm exec nx run mobile:build` and verify success
  - [ ] 8.1.4: **Immediate test**: Run `pnpm exec nx run mobile:start` and verify Expo dev server starts
  - [ ] 8.1.5: **Immediate test**: Run `pnpm exec nx run mobile:lint` and verify passes
  - [ ] 8.1.6: **Immediate test**: Run `pnpm exec nx run mobile:test` and verify passes

  - [ ] 8.3.4: Display health check data from server
  - [ ] 8.3.5: Add button to ping server
  - [ ] 8.3.6: Test on Expo Go or development build

- [ ] **8.4: Cross-platform integration testing**
  - [ ] 8.4.1: Test that mobile and web can both read same data
  - [ ] 8.4.2: Test that data created on web appears on mobile (after refresh)
  - [ ] 8.4.3: Test that data created on mobile appears on web (after refresh)
  - [ ] 8.4.4: Verify data synchronization

- [ ] **8.5: Mobile-specific considerations**

## Overall Success Criteria

Phase 1 is complete when ALL of the following are true:

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Two applications exist and run: server, web
- [ ] Four shared packages exist and build: database, schemas, api-client, supabase-client
- [ ] Walking skeleton feature works end-to-end:
  - [ ] Web app displays data from Supabase via server
  - [ ] Web app can write data to Supabase via server
  - [ ] Data persists correctly in database

### Technical Requirements

- [ ] CI pipeline passes on main branch
- [ ] E2E tests exist and pass for critical flows

### External Services Requirements (Optional)
- [ ] Sentry error tracking configured (optional)
- [ ] Nx Cloud is optimized and remote caching works
- [ ] CodeRabbit is configured appropriately
- [ ] Dependabot is actively monitoring dependencies
- [ ] TestSprite evaluated and configured if chosen (optional)

### Documentation Requirements
- [ ] Package version baseline exists in `docs/package-versions-baseline.md`
- [ ] Prerequisites documented in `docs/prerequisites.md`
- [ ] Environment setup documented in `docs/environment-setup.md`

- [ ] Walking skeleton architecture documented in `docs/walking-skeleton.md`
- [ ] External services documented in `docs/external-services.md`
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide exists
- [ ] Any deviations from plan are documented with rationale

### Validation Test (The Final Proof)
The ultimate test that Phase 1 is complete:

**A new developer should be able to:**
1. Clone the repository
2. Review prerequisites and install required tools
3. Run `pnpm install`
4. Set up environment variables (following documented steps)
5. Run `pnpm exec nx run-many -t build`
6. Run `pnpm exec nx run web:dev` and `pnpm exec nx run server:serve` concurrently
7. Access the web app and see the walking skeleton working
8. Make a change to a shared package
9. See only affected apps rebuild
10. Commit their change and see Git hooks enforce quality
11. Push and see CI pass

**If all 11 steps work flawlessly, Phase 1 is complete.**

---

## Next Steps After Phase 1

Once Phase 1 is complete, we will:

1. **Decide on mobile timing** - Add mobile now (Stage 8) or defer to later?
2. **Create Phase 2: POC PRD** - Define the exact functionality of the task management POC
3. **Create Phase 3: POC Implementation Plan** - Plan how to build the POC on top of our validated foundation
4. **Execute POC Implementation** - Build the POC with confidence that infrastructure works

The walking skeleton code (health check) can remain in the codebase as a reference implementation or be removed once the POC is complete.
