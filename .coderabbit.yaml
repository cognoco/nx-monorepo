  # Project-wide review instructions
  instructions: |
    This is an NX monorepo in early development/scaffolding phase.

    FOCUS reviews on:
    1. Package and dependency compatibility issues, especially between apps in apps/ and shared components in packages/
    2. Critical bugs and security vulnerabilities
    3. Architectural pattern violations
    4. Breaking changes to established APIs
    5. Logic errors and incorrect implementations
    6. Race conditions and concurrency issues

    SKIP or DEFER:
    - Style/formatting issues (handled by ESLint/Prettier)
    - TODOs and incomplete implementations
    - Premature performance optimizations
    - Missing documentation (until features are complete)
    - Minor naming suggestions
    - Trivial refactoring suggestions

    Be constructive and focus on high-impact issues only.

  # Path-based review instructions for targeted reviews
