## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]  
**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [single/web/mobile - determines source structure]  
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Research Validation

**Status**: [✅ Complete | ❌ Required but not yet performed | ⚠️ Partial - tool unavailable]

**MCP Servers Used**:
- [ ] Context7 (official documentation)
- [ ] Exa (production code examples)
- [ ] Web search (industry standards)

**Material Changes Validated** (check all that apply):
- [ ] New external libraries/frameworks
- [ ] Cross-project architecture/build/test/config
- [ ] Public API contracts or data model
- [ ] Security or infrastructure
- [ ] Database schema or ORM configuration
- [ ] None - no material changes in this plan

**Research Areas Validated**:
1. [Technology/Pattern 1] - [✅ Validated | ⚠️ Changes Required | ❌ Anti-pattern]
   - Source: [Context7/Exa/Web]
   - Finding: [Brief summary]

2. [Technology/Pattern 2] - [Validation status]
   - Source: [Context7/Exa/Web]
   - Finding: [Brief summary]

[Continue for all technology areas...]

**Critical Findings**:
- [Any anti-patterns discovered]
- [Missing configurations]
- [Required changes to original assumptions]

**Validated Patterns** (no changes needed):
- [Pattern 1] - Validated by [Context7/Exa/Web]
- [Pattern 2] - Validated by [Context7/Exa/Web]

**Research Document**: See `specs/[feature-name]/research-validation.md` for complete findings with code examples.

**Gate Status**:
- [ ] ✅ External validation complete - Ready for implementation
- [ ] ❌ Research incomplete - BLOCKER (must complete before implementation)
- [ ] ⚠️ Tool unavailable - User notified and provided guidance

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

[Gates determined based on constitution file]

## Governance Alignment

**Status**: [✅ Aligned | ⚠️ Conflicts Resolved | ❌ Conflicts Exist]

**Documents Checked**:
- [ ] docs/architecture-decisions.md
- [ ] docs/memories/adopted-patterns.md
- [ ] docs/tech-stack.md
- [ ] docs/P1-plan.md

**Alignment Summary**:
1. **Architecture Decisions**: [Status]
   - Checked: [relevant decisions]
   - Conflicts: [None | list + resolution]
2. **Adopted Patterns**: [Status]
   - Checked: [relevant patterns]
   - Conflicts: [None | list + resolution]
3. **Tech Stack Constraints**: [Status]
   - Checked: [constraints]
   - Conflicts: [None | list + resolution]
4. **Phase/Stage Requirements**: [Status]
   - Checked: [current phase requirements verified]
   - Conflicts: [None | list + resolution]

**Gate Status**: [✅ Ready for Phase 0 | ❌ Blockers exist]

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
