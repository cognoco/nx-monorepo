Next I want to quality check the content of all of the standards files. 

I want to start by making sure that the tech stack document is complete and correct. By this I mean that the (major) Versions and the installed (pinned) versions are actually compatible. I want you to investigate each and every mentioned technology for its compatibility with the others! To do this, I'm thinking to leverage your Context7 MCP server, your Sequential Thinking MCP server, and your web search capabilities. I would suggest locating the appropriate documentation for each technology on the company's documentation websites or Github or equivalent, and double-check with information from Context7.

However, I'm not entirely certain that this would be the best way to research this, and I would like you to have a think about alternative options. Give me three possible approaches with pros and cons and your recommendation, with rationale. Quality is of the utmost importance and trumps cost, time and effort spent!

So in essence, what is the best way to ensure that the versions that we pin here follow best practices and are actually completely compatible?
