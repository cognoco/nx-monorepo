# Memory Checkpoint

You have just completed a task. Now reflect on whether anything from this work should be documented in the memory system to prevent future rework or pattern drift.

## Step 1: Review What You Just Did

Briefly summarize the work you just completed:
- What was the task?
- What components were generated, modified, or configured?
- What problems did you solve?
- What patterns did you follow or discover?

## Step 2: Check Existing Documentation

**FIRST - Check if already documented:**
1. `.ruler/AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md` - General project practices, workflows, technology choices
2. Official framework documentation (Next.js, Nx, Prisma, etc.)

**If NOT already covered there, read memory system files:**
1. `docs/memories/README.md` - Understand the memory system structure and principles
2. `docs/memories/adopted-patterns.md` - Current monorepo architectural standards
3. `docs/memories/post-generation-checklist.md` - Current post-generation steps
4. `docs/memories/tech-findings-log.md` - Current technical findings

**Purpose**: Avoid duplicating existing documentation. Memory system captures GAPS, not general practices.

## Step 3: Identify What Should Be Documented

**Documentation Hierarchy:**
- **AGENTS.md**: General project practices (e.g., "we use Jest for testing")
- **Memory System**: Monorepo-specific architectural decisions, patterns, constraints

Ask yourself these questions:

**Adopted Patterns** (`adopted-patterns.md`):
- Did I make an **intentional architectural decision** through structured design discussion?
- Did I establish a **new standard** that should apply consistently across similar components?
- Did I discover a **framework default that conflicts** with our architectural choices?
- Did an **emerging pattern** surface from solving cross-component problems?
- Did I solve a problem that will **recur when adding similar components**?

**Post-Generation Checklist** (`post-generation-checklist.md`):
- Did I have to **fix generator output** that conflicts with our adopted patterns?
- Will this same fix be **needed every time** we run this generator?
- Is this fix **mandatory** to maintain consistency with our architecture?

**Tech Findings Log** (`tech-findings-log.md`):
- Did I make a **technical decision with non-obvious rationale**?
- Did I discover **empirical findings** through troubleshooting?
- Did I identify a **constraint or limitation** of a tool/framework?
- Did I investigate and **reject alternatives** for specific reasons?

**None of the Above** (most common outcome):
- Was this straightforward implementation following existing patterns?
- Is this already documented in AGENTS.md or official framework docs?
- Was this a one-time fix that won't recur?
- Is this too specific to one component?

## Step 4: Update Memory Files (If Applicable)

If you identified knowledge that should be documented:

**For Adopted Patterns:**
1. Add a new pattern section using the template in `adopted-patterns.md`
2. Include: pattern description, rationale, validation steps, "when to apply" guidance
3. Update the "last-updated" date in frontmatter

**For Post-Generation Checklist:**
1. Add a new checklist section using the template in `post-generation-checklist.md`
2. Include: issue description, required actions, validation commands
3. Update the "last-updated" date in frontmatter

**For Tech Findings Log:**
1. Add a new entry using the template in `tech-findings-log.md`
2. Include: decision, context, alternatives considered, technical rationale
3. Update the "last-updated" date in frontmatter

## Step 5: Report Back

Provide a summary:

**If you documented something:**
- Which file(s) did you update?
- What pattern/checklist/finding did you add?
- Why is this important for future work?

**If nothing needs documenting:**
- Explain why (e.g., one-time fix, already documented, too specific)

## Guidelines

**DO document** when:
- ✅ Intentional architectural decision from design discussion
- ✅ Pattern that emerged from solving cross-component problems
- ✅ Generator output conflicts with our architectural choices
- ✅ Technical constraint or limitation discovered
- ✅ Decision with non-obvious rationale that prevents future rework

**DON'T document** when:
- ❌ Already documented in AGENTS.md or official framework docs
- ❌ General project practice without monorepo-specific nuance
- ❌ One-time fix or edge case
- ❌ Specific to single component
- ❌ Personal preference without technical requirement
- ❌ Work completed smoothly following existing patterns

## Smell Tests

**Red flags that suggest NOTHING should be documented:**
- "I'm documenting how we generally do X" → Check if already in AGENTS.md
- Entry would be >100 lines → Too general, probably duplicating existing docs
- "This worked fine without any issues" → Then nothing needs documenting
- "Here's how to use [framework feature]" → Link to official docs instead

**Green lights that suggest something SHOULD be documented:**
- "We chose X instead of framework default Y because..." → adopted-patterns.md
- "Generator created Z, I had to change it to W" → post-generation-checklist.md
- "I discovered constraint C through troubleshooting" → tech-findings-log.md
- "This decision prevents future problem P" → Appropriate memory file

## Quality Check

Before finishing, verify:
- [ ] Used the appropriate template from the target file
- [ ] Included clear rationale (why, not just what)
- [ ] Added validation/verification steps
- [ ] Updated "last-updated" date in frontmatter
- [ ] Cross-referenced related documentation

**Remember**: The memory system prevents pattern drift. Quality documentation now saves hours of debugging later.
